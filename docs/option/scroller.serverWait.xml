	<description>
		When using server-side processing (`dt-init serverSide`), Scroller will wait a small amount of time to allow the scrolling to finish before requesting more data from the server. This can be useful to help prevent you from DDoSing your own server with frequent Ajax requests as the user scrolls through a table!

		The wait time can be configured by this parameter.
