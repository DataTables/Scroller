<title lib="Scroller">Client-side data source (50,000 rows)</title>

<info><![CDATA[

This example is completely artificial in that the data generated is created on the client-side by just looping around a Javascript array and then passing that to DataTables. However, it does show that DataTables and Scroller can easily cope with large amounts of data on the client-side. Typically, data such as this would be Ajax sourced and server-side processing would be implemented.

Please be aware that because of the data generation, the performance of this page will depend on your browser - for example IE6 will crawl!
